## Problem Title
Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
1. AI-Powered Job Interview Simulator
A web-based platform that simulates real-life job interviews using AI-driven selectors. Applicants interact with an AI interviewer, answering questions that are analyzed for content, confidence, and clarity.
2. Skill-Based Selector Simulation
A system where applicants complete technical or skill-based tests that are dynamically created based on selector-defined criteria.
3. Gamified Selection Process Simulator
A web app that turns the selection process into a gamified experience where applicants go through different levels of assessment.
4. Virtual Assessment Center
An online simulation of an assessment center where selectors can observe applicants in virtual scenarios like group discussions and case studies.
5. Behavioral Assessment Through AI-Based Chatbot
A chatbot-based simulator where applicants answer scenario-based questions to assess decision-making and emotional intelligence.
